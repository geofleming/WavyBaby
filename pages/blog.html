							<h2>Baby is Flying...Quite Literally!</h2>
							<h4>Blog posted 05 Sep 2017</h4>
							<p>So it's been a while since our last blog, time is flying by but in a good way!  Week 26 already.</p>
							<p>Louise is heading back to Dublin this week and Baby has their first long-haul flight, although we can't claim the baby airmiles.  Baby will have clocked up some amount of miles before birth given all the recent travels to all the hotspots..New Zealand, Perth, Sydney.  Louise would love to have travelled to see everyone in Edinburgh but it was just one flight too many.  We will see you all soon though.</p>
							<p>So there has been lots happening.</p>
							<p>Baby is now very active and for the first time a few weeks ago, on my Dad's birthday of all days, I could feel our little one kicking.  It's the first moment for me with the physical connection and made me very happy!  Now we're at the stage you can see the bump ripple.  Not long now until we see the hand and foot imprints!</p>
							<p>The side effect of all this kicking is the many times Louise gets a 'boot' or the regular morning wake up call (kick) at 4:30am!</p>
							<p>The bump has been growing at pace and keeping Louise busy with the number of new clothes needed.  Louise looks fantastic though and as you would say is glowing and enjoying every minute of the pregnancy.</p>
							<p>Louise is past the point now where the bump can be hidden from view.  We have had the experience though of a great response from all our new friends around Port Melbourne who have been ecstatically happy for us.  The excitement continues and hopefully a few more free coffees and cakes!</p>
							<p>We have also been busy preparing and have the swish and trendy pram ordered from <a href="https://www.redsbaby.com.au/jive-single-stroller-bassinet-mist/" alt="link to redsbaby pram">redsbaby</a> along with the cot, crib, car seat, changing table etc....  Now we just need somewhere to put it all.</p>
							<p>Love you all...from the 3 of us...Louise, George and Wavy Baby xxx.</p>

							<h2>Pink or Blue.... It's a.... ?</h2>
							<h4>Blog posted 25 Jul 2017</h4>
							<p>For anyone not wanting to know the sex of the baby look away now!!</p>
							<p>Ah only kidding.  We donâ€™t even know ourselves!  More on that shortly.</p>
							<p>Week 20 already, half way there, it hasn't half flown by quickly. Louise and Wavy Baby are both doing well and getting to know each other better day by day.</p>
							<p>Our Week 20 scan was today and went very well...all fingers and toes are there.  It's amazing to see for ourselves how our little baby has formed and grown since the last scan at 12 weeks.  The heartbeat is strong and sounding great.  In around 20 weeks they will be in our arms.</p>
							<p>Now onto the scan itself.  Sorry for the poor quality but I hadn't realised at this scan we would not be given a multitude of scan pictures and the sound of the heartbeat to take home with us.  I had to take a picture from the Sonographer computer screen and it wasn't the best quality.  Our little baby was also a tad shy this morning and obviously wished for some privacy as not playing to the camera this time round.  Don't blame them!</p>
							<p>So this led to us not being able to get an understanding of the sex of the baby as we tried many times but baby was not positioned to really know.  The suspense remains, maybe next time though.</p>
							<p>We are just both relieved and so so very happy to be at this point and can't wait to meet them.</p>
							<p>Love you all...from the 3 of us...Louise, George and Wavy Baby xxx.</p>

							<h2>So.... We're Having a Baby!</h2>
							<h4>Blog posted 28 Jun 2017</h4>
							<p>Well I say "we", its all Louise doing the work whilst I have the congratulatory slap on the back and pints in the pub!</p>
							<p>Louise and the baby are doing well, now we're over the initial getting to know each other phase by draining Louise's energy on a daily basis, otherwise known as Trimester 1.</p>
							<p>We then thought how can we get everyone involved and keep up-to-date on progress.</p>
							<p>We have put together this website not only to show off my amazing new talents, thank you very much, but also too keep everyone involved.  We got the idea of Wavy Baby from the 11 week scan in which the Sonographer capture the perfect image of the baby waving to us...or at least thats what we thought!</p>
							<p>We have posted to the world wide web our precious baby mug shots, otherwise known as the scans, and whilst Louise allows it we'll post progress of the bump as we go.</p>
							<p>I hope you all like the site and get some good feeling from it.  We will build the site as we go along and will get you more involved in some hilarity from any ideas we come up with.  Also open to any ideas you guys have too.</p>
							<p>Love you all...from the 3 of us...Louise, George and Wavy Baby xxx.</p>
