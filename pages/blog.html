							<h2>Pink or Blue.... It's a.... ?</h2>
							<h4>Blog posted 25 Jul 2017</h4>
							<p>For anyone not wanting to know the sex of the baby look away now!!</p>
							<p>Ah only kidding.  We donâ€™t even know ourselves!  More on that shortly.</p>
							<p>Week 20 already, half way there, it hasn't half flown by quickly. Louise and Wavy Baby are both doing well and getting to know each other better day by day.</p>
							<p>Our Week 20 scan was today and went very well...all fingers and toes are there.  It's amazing to see for ourselves how our little baby has formed and grown since the last scan at 12 weeks.  The heartbeat is strong and sounding great.  In around 20 weeks they will be in our arms.</p>
							<p>Now onto the scan itself.  Sorry for the poor quality but I hadn't realised at this scan we would not be given a multitude of scan pictures and the sound of the heartbeat to take home with us.  I had to take a picture from the Sonographer computer screen and it wasn't the best quality.  Our little baby was also a tad shy this morning and obviously wished for some privacy as not playing to the camera this time round.  Don't blame them!</p>
							<p>So this led to us not being able to get an understanding of the sex of the baby as we tried many times but baby was not positioned to really know.  The suspense remains, maybe next time though.</p>
							<p>We are just both relieved and so so very happy to be at this point and can't wait to meet them.</p>
							<p>Love you all...from the 3 of us...Louise, George and Wavy Baby xxx.</p>

							<h2>So.... We're Having a Baby!</h2>
							<h4>Blog posted 28 Jun 2017</h4>
							<p>Well I say "we", its all Louise doing the work whilst I have the congratulatory slap on the back and pints in the pub!</p>
							<p>Louise and the baby are doing well, now we're over the initial getting to know each other phase by draining Louise's energy on a daily basis, otherwise known as Trimester 1.</p>
							<p>We then thought how can we get everyone involved and keep up-to-date on progress.</p>
							<p>We have put together this website not only to show off my amazing new talents, thank you very much, but also too keep everyone involved.  We got the idea of Wavy Baby from the 11 week scan in which the Sonographer capture the perfect image of the baby waving to us...or at least thats what we thought!</p>
							<p>We have posted to the world wide web our precious baby mug shots, otherwise known as the scans, and whilst Louise allows it we'll post progress of the bump as we go.</p>
							<p>I hope you all like the site and get some good feeling from it.  We will build the site as we go along and will get you more involved in some hilarity from any ideas we come up with.  Also open to any ideas you guys have too.</p>
							<p>Love you all...from the 3 of us...Louise, George and Wavy Baby xxx.</p>
